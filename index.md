  # Ciao! 
  I’m Manfredi Miraula — Data & AI Engineer and Technical Lead.
  I help companies build reliable data pipelines and intelligent systems using tools like Azure, Databricks, and modern AI frameworks.

  With over 10 years of experience in data, I’ve worked with startups, enterprises, and global companies to deliver scalable ETL workflows, LLM-powered applications, and end-to-end data platforms.

  This site is where I share my projects, ideas, and what I’m learning while freelancing and building AI-powered products.
