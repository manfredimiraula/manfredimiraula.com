My name is Manfredi Miraula, 

I'm a professional more than 5 years of experience in the Analytics space and a self-taugt Python developer. I offer consulting services in the Analytics space and technical mentoring for folks changing career into Data Science/Engineering.

Do you have an interesting project that could benefit from my experience? Contact me!

### My story
I had a stint in Academia, doing research for the University of Queensland in Australia and the Maynooth University in Ireland. Once obtained my PhD in Chemistry, I decided to move to the industry and the rest is history...! I fell in love with programming and I decided to continue towards a career in tech, programming and Analytics. 

When I'm not at my laptop, I enjoy painting miniatures, CrossFit or climbing, and cooking
